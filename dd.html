    I am a seasoned digital marketing and SEO guru with a track record in
    results-driven leadership. As NetRepâ„¢ VP of Reputation Management
    Operations, I provide the expert insight and mentorship needed to
    consistently improve and optimize deliverables while boosting team
    performance and empowering long-term client success. As in my previous
    roles, I always tried to improve workflows by developing process efficiency
    programs. These programs have boosted productivity and increased employee
    retention. I am also taking an active role in researching emerging industry
    and marketing trends, It gives me the information which I need to help the
    company make strategic business decisions. My leadership has been recognized
    time and again for its attention to detail and its ability to drive results.
    When I am not assisting any clients or spearheading new process initiatives,
    I like to spend time with my family, traveling in Europe and the Americas,
    or engaging in outdoor activities near my home in Southern California. I am
    highly sought-after for my digital marketing experience; as a member of SEO
    Rockstars, I am a frequent guest speaker, volunteer, and participant in
    mentoring the next generation of digital professionals.

        company, I was responsible for developing customer bases, implementing
